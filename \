\subsection{Ideals}
An ideal is similar to a subalgebra, but has a stronger limiting condition. 
\begin{definition}
An \vocab{ideal} of a Lie Algebra $L$ is a subspace $I$ such that 
\[ [x,y] \in I \text{ }\forall x\in L \text{ and } y \in I. \] 
Any ideal is also a subalgebra of $L$. 
\end{definition}
This is the analog to an ideal for a ring. 

\begin{example}[Quotient Algebra]
Let $L$ be a Lie algebra, and $I \subset L$ be an ideal. Then the vector space $L/I$ is also a Lie algebra. The vectors are the \emph{cosets} 
\[ x + I = \{x+y | y \in I \} \subset L. \] We define the bracket as 
\[ [x+I, y+I] = [x+y] + I. \] As all $[x,y] \in I$, this is well defined for cosets. This Lie algebra is called the \vocab{quotient algebra}.  
\end{example}

Let $M$ and $N$ be subspaces of $L$, an arbitrary Lie algebra. Then 
\[ [M,N] = \Span\{[x,y] | x \in M, y \in N\} = \Span \{\sum_{i} [x_i,y_i] | x_i \in M, y_i \in N. \] 
In particular, if $M$ is a subalgebra, then 
\[ [M,M] \subseteq M, \] and if $M$ is an ideal, then \[ [L,M] \subseteq M. \] 

\begin{definition}
The \vocab{derived algebra} of $L$ is $[L,L]$. 
\end{definition}

We also have the following: 
\begin{lemma*}
$[L,L] \subset L$ is an ideal, which implies it is a subalgebra, and thus itself is a Lie algebra. 
\end{lemma*}
\begin{proof}
Let $I = [L,L]$, which is a subspace of $L$ by constraint. Then 
\[ [L,I] \subseteq [L,L] = I, \] as $I \subseteq L$, and we are done. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma*}
Let $L = \mathfrak{gl}(n)$. Then 
\[ [L,L] = \frak{sl}(n). \] 
\end{lemma*}
\begin{proof}
We have $[L,L] \subseteq \frak{sl}(n)$, as the trace of any commutator is equal to 0. 
\end{proof}<++>
